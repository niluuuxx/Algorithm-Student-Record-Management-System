📌 Description
This project is a menu-driven Student Record Management System, designed to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student records using a structured approach.
It uses a simple data structure to store and manage student information, including roll number, name, and marks. The application is interactive and guides the user through various options via a command-line interface.

🚀 Features
•	✅ Add new student records
•	📋 Display all existing records
•	🔍 Search for a student by roll number
•	✏️ Update existing student data
•	🗑️ Delete a student record
•	🔁 Menu-driven interface with continuous looping until Exit

🛠️ Algorithm Overview
1.	Initialize
o	Define a structure Student with fields: rollNumber, name, and marks.
o	Declare an array of Student to hold multiple records.
o	Use a variable count to keep track of the number of current records.
2.	Display Menu
o	Show the user a list of operations to perform.
3.	Process Choice (Switch-Case)
o	Case 1: Add a new student (if capacity allows).
o	Case 2: Display all student records.
o	Case 3: Search a student by roll number.
o	Case 4: Update an existing student's details.
o	Case 5: Delete a student by roll number.
o	Case 6: Exit the application.
o	Default: Handle invalid inputs.
4.	Loop Back
o	After every operation except Exit, return to the main menu.
